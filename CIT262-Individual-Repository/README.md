Hi team, my name is Levi.

On april 22nd I turned 27, I've been married for 2 years and expecting to get sealed really soon since we got married during COVID and we have
no temples in Nicaragua, also my wife would like to have her family for the sealing and we haven't been able to make it together, but the plan is to get sealed this 
year hopefully for summer break, we are so excited about it. 

I love videos games, I spend most of my time with my wife and also playing video games such as: Gears of war 5, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft, I have played wow since 2008
when Wrath of the Lich King came out, my computer was pretty bad but even running it with 10fps made me happy.
